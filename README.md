# spdisk
This is my first publicly accessed application that I have produced in a long time.  It is a beta version that has been tested on Windows 10 and Server 2012 single disk systems.  I will be creating a multi disk version shortly.
A $10.00 donation would be greatly appreciated.  Money can be sent to my paypal account. john.wilhelmi@gmail.com


Based upon Get-PhysicalDisk, SPdisk allows a technician to quickly retrieve disk information on a laptop. If loaded and ran on a Windows 8.1 or greater Laptop,
it will present the user with Manufacturer, serial number, media type and health status. It's very small (412KB), and portable.

Using the app is easy.  Just copy to any folder on your computer and double click the exe.  No installation is required.


Let me know what you think.  
John
